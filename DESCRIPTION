Title: R Implementation of the iRF and iRF-LOOP algorithms using Ranger (fast) Random Forest under the hood
Version: 0.1.0
Author: David Kainer
Maintainer: David Kainer <dkainer@outlook.com>
Description: iRF provides a boosting and feature selection aspect to standard RF by taking the feature importances 
    from an RF run and using them as the feature sampling probabilities in the next RF run. 
    It will keep doing this for i iterations, so some features will be culled (reach zero importance) while others get boosted. 
    iRF-LOOP runs the iRF algorithm once for every feature in a matrix, such that each feature takes a turn to be the Y variable. 
    If there are n features then iRF is run n times.
