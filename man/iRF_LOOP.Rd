a data.frame containing the edges of the resulting network. This will have 4 columns:
\describe{
  \item{featX}{predictive feature}
  \item{featY}{feature being predicted}

\details{
Given a data set of n features and m samples, iRF Leave One Out Prediction (iRF-LOOP)
starts by treating one feature as the dependent variable (Y) and the
remaining n âˆ’ 1 features as predictors (X matrix).
Using an iRF model, the importance of each feature in X, for predicting Y, is calculated.
The result is a vector, of size n, of importance scores (the importance score of Y,
for predicting itself is set to zero). This process is repeated for each of the n features,
requiring n iRF runs which produces n vectors of importance scores.
To keep importance scores on the same scale across the n runs, each run's result is
normalized relative to the sum of that run's importance score vector. When all n runs are combined
it represents a directed network where features are the nodes, and the ability of one feature to predict another
(conditional on all other features) is represented as edges between nodes with weights defined by normalized importance scores.

    iRF-LOOP does the same overall process as **GENIE3**, but replaces the standard RF model with iRF.
    Walker et al (2022) demonstrated that replacing RF with iRF produces smaller and less noisy networks when
    applied to gene expression data. True positive edges usually rank higher in the edge list (ranked by importance score)
    when using iRF-LOOP rather than GENIE3.

    iRF-LOOP can be used on any type of input data as long as it is in matrix form. However, for very large
    datasets where there may be tens of thousands of predictors (e.g. whole transcriptome expression data in hundreds of samples),
    this R package is likely to take considerable run time due to the need to run 10s of thousands of iRF models. For these
    situations we direct the user to the massively parallel [HPC implementation]<https://github.com/Jromero1208/RangerBasediRF>

\examples{
data(expdata)
## make a Predictive Expression Network
pen <- iRF_LOOP(expdata, num.trees=100)

## view top 10 edges in resulting PEN
## Not run:
top <- pen[order(pen$imp, decreasing = TRUE),][1:10,]
## note that the some top edges may come from a very poor model (low R2)
